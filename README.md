# Project Description
In this project, I have used Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Deep Learning to predict if a customer will stop purchasing services from Teclo. Logistic Regression Classifier performed the best with an accuracy of 78.7%%.

Feature importance of the Logistic Regression Model showed that month to month contracts is an important factor in deciding if a customer will churn or not. 

Exploratory data analysis also showed that customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn. 

This analysis can be used to  understand the reason behind churn numbers and tackle those factors, with reactive action plans.
